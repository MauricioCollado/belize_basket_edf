Hi,

In this readme I will describe the columns:

- basket: basket ID where the species belong
- per_quota: percentage of the MSY sum quota approach
- tot_profits: total profits = (sum of harvest species i * price species i) - effort*cost
- effort.t_1 : effort of technology 1
- species: common species name
- biomass: stock
- harvest: species extraction
- revenue: price*harvest
- exploitation.rate: harvest/lag(biomass) the lag is one period
