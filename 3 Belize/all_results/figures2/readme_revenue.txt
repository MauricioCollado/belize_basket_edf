Hi

In this folder I compare the REVENUE PER SPECIES with the conservation goal (B_t>Bmsy).

Revenue of species i = (price or value of species i)*(harvest of species i)

I sum the revenues of species i across all periods (no discount rate) 
and divide it by the revenue of species i under individual scheme.

***NOTE***

As we can see some species get greater revenues at the expense of others.
