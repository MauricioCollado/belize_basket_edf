Hi

In this folder I compare the TOTAL PROFITS with the conservation goal (B_t>Bmsy).

The total profits are total revenues minus total costs. 

Where: 

total revenues = price*harvest per species 
total costs = - effort * cost.

The we sum the profits across ALL YEARS (No discount rate, fishermen are myopic)

I divide the total profits across time by the total profits across time under individual management.
